<small>I am a Ph.D. candidate at City University of Hong Kong (CityU), advised by [Prof. Kede Ma](https://kedema.org/).</small>  
<small>I am interested in video quality assessment. You can find my CV [here](https://github.com/winwinwenwen77/wenwen.github.io/blob/master/assets/wenwen_cv.pdf).</small>  
<small>I have interned at ByteDance Multimedia Lab, and worked as a student researcher at Google YouTube.</small>  
<small>If you have any ideas you'd like to discuss, please don't hesitate to reach out to me.</small>
